This document gives guidelines for classifying issues in JIRA.

**Priority 1:**
* Crashes that affect a large number of users.
* Bugs that make a core feature of the app unusable for a large number of users.
* Anything that causes user data to be lost.
* Features or enhancements that have been prioritized by product owners for the next release.

**Priority 2:**
* Crashes that affect a subset of users or only occur occasionally.
*Â Bugs that cause a very bad experience for a subset of users, making a feature of the app difficult to use, but don't result in a loss of user data.
* Features or enhancements that are important to product owners but don't necessarily have to make it into the next release.

**Priority 3:**
* Bugs and bad experiences that only affect a few users, only occur in a limited context, or do not affect overall usability of the app.
* Features or enhancements that have not been prioritized by product owners.
