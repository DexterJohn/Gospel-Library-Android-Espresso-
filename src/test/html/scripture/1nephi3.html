    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067676" id="p2"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I have dreamed a <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note2a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>dream</span>, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note2b"><sup class="marker">b</sup>return</span> to Jerusalem.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067677" id="p3"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note3a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>genealogy</span> of my forefathers, and they are <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note3b"><sup class="marker">b</sup>engraven</span> upon plates of brass.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067678" id="p4"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067679" id="p5"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it of <span class="page-break" data-page="6"></span>them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067680" id="p6"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord, because thou hast <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note6a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>not</span> <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note6b"><sup class="marker">b</sup>murmured</span>.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067681" id="p7"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note7a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>will</span> go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note7b"><sup class="marker">b</sup>commandments</span> unto the children of men, save he shall <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note7c"><sup class="marker">c</sup>prepare</span> a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067682" id="p8"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words he was exceedingly glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of the Lord.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067683" id="p9"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And I, Nephi, and my brethren took our journey in the wilderness, with our tents, to go up to the land of Jerusalem.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067684" id="p10"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of Jerusalem, I and my brethren did consult one with another.</p>

And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in unto the house of Laban, and he talked with him as he sat in his house.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067686" id="p12"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, which contained the <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note12a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>genealogy</span> of my father.</p>

    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067688" id="p14"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things which Laban had done, unto us. And we began to be exceedingly sorrowful, and my brethren were about to return unto my father in the wilderness.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067689" id="p15"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>But behold I said unto them that: <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note15a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>As</span> the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note15b"><sup class="marker">b</sup>accomplished</span> the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067690" id="p16"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father’s <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note16a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>inheritance</span>, for behold he left gold and silver, and all manner of riches.

    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067691" id="p17"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>For he knew that Jerusalem must be <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note17a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>destroyed</span>, because of the wickedness of the people.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067692" id="p18"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>For behold, they have <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note18a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>rejected</span> the words of the prophets.

    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067693" id="p19"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note19a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>records</span>, that we may preserve unto our children the language of our fathers;</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067694" id="p20"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And also that we may <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note20a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>preserve</span> unto them the words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note20b"><sup class="marker">b</sup>prophets</span>, which have been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down unto this present time.</p>

    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067695" id="p21"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note21a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>persuade</span> my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the commandments of God.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067696" id="p22"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our inheritance, and we did gather together our <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note22a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>gold</span>, and our silver, and our precious things.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067697" id="p23"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And after we had gathered these things together, we went up again unto the house of Laban.</p>

    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067699" id="p25"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and that it was exceedingly great, he did <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note25a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>lust</span> after it, insomuch that he thrust us out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he might obtain our property.</p>
    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067700" id="p26"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note26a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>it</span> came to pass that we did flee before the servants of Laban, and we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it fell into the hands of Laban.</p>

    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067702" id="p28"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the words of Laman.

    <p class="verse" data-aid="19067703" id="p29"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, behold, an <span class="study-note-ref" data-ref="note29a"><sup class="marker">a</sup>angel</span> of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto them, saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod?
